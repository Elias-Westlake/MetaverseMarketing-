     The metaverse is quickly growing. With “metaverse” keywords yielding 677,000 search results,
     #metaverse holding 60,000+ instagram posts and 500+ tweets per hour, interest in the metaverse
     is predicted to continue expanding. Though marketing on the metaverse, there are a range of
     strategies to increase campaign effectiveness. By paralleling metaverse marketing to real-life
     campaigns, a familiar, connected interaction is created. It is key to ensure that virtual
     metaverse marketing has a focus on engaging with existing communities on the platform and
     being immersive in nature to be the most effective. Additionally, tying metaverse marketing
     to collectibles that can be owned by users will benefit the campaign and user engagement.
     Also, with how new and dynamic the metaverse currently is, it is key to keep experimenting
     with marketing. This will allow marketers to keep abreast of new strategies and gain
     first-mover benefits.

  <p class="option-1-text"> <br>One of the biggest new platforms for marketing became very clear during the
    pandemic which is marketing in the metaverse. The metaverse is a digital environment populated by virtual
    avatars representing actual people much like a video game and in some situations are video games. There
    are many reasons why marketers are flocking to the metaverse. It’s new, and faster connections finally
    exist to support growing environments. But maybe the most important reason is marketers want to target
    and keep Millennials and Gen X up-to-date and engaged with their products and technologies, and metaverses
    allow them to target these audiences in a new way. New non-gaming metaverses are starting to appear more
    regularly. Virtual conventions are now taking place in the metaverse. Attendees can go to a bunch of
    booths without leaving their office or home. An example of how it could be used is if you think about
    car shows and the potential reach as if they moved to the metaverse. Put on some virtual reality glasses
    and “sit” in a car to experience and see it from the inside out. These types of events could be very
    creatively done.

  <p class="option-1-text"> This article gives a general overview of what the metaverse is.
    The article then goes more in depth into the ramifications of this new technology for
    marketers and brands. One major point that the article mentioned is the importance of the
    “snapchat” generation. “The Snapchat Generation has over $4.4 trillion in global spending
    power, and beyond that carries a massive influence on household purchasing (over 80% of
    parents of Gen Z report that this generation influences household spend)”. This is the
    generation that will be the first adapted to the metaverse and become the first virtual
    consumers. Overall the article mentioned that the metaverse is coming and will be an
    important part of marketing for years to come and in a matter of time there will be a
    plethora of activities and business transactions occurring across a variety of metaverse
    platforms.
